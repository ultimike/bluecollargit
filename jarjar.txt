In the long decades of Star Wars content, there probably hasn’t been a character as nearly universally reviled
as the Gungan Jar Jar Binks.
First seen in The Phantom Menace, Jar Jar was met with instant criticism for being unfunny, childish, maybe a touch racist,
and overall tonally out of place character.
For a movie that was already considered bad in some circles, it didn’t need that handicap as well. Lucas realized
his mistake pretty quickly, and he had a lot less screen time in Attack of the Clones, and almost none in Revenge of the Sith.
Lucas was banking on Jar Jar being a funny character to add levity, and he couldn’t have failed harder if he tried.

I know everybody hates on JarJar Binks. But ya know what. I like Jar Jar. Maybe it's cause I was like 10 when
that movie came out. But I liked him. I like The Phantom Menace. My only real problem with the prequels was the horrible
writing. And the lack of chemistry between Anakin and Padme.

Oh hey look, this is an example of a code conflict - Mike wrote this line of code.

Bar Bar Jinks.

I had a dream about a pig-bear with varying shades of green fur. 
The pig-bear was getting his tummy rubbed.

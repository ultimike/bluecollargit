Hey this is Matt. Cats are great. The legends of Yeti and Bigfoot and Matt have
been around for decades – even centuries, and I remember my early exposure to
the Yeti story following the first ascent of Mt. Everest (Sagarmatha) by Tenzing
Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary on May 29, 1953. I was almost four years old then
and, as a budding primatologist, completely fascinated by the possibility that
such a fantastic animal might exist. Norgay and Hillary saw and photographed
huge footprints crossing a snowfield in the high Himalayas (which had actually
been reported earlier in a 1951 reconnaissance expedition, but it was the Mt.
Everest expedition that truly brought it to the world’s attention), and it
created quite an international stir. Not to be outdone, in the United States, we
resurrected the ancient Northwest Native American legend of Sasquatch, baptizing
it “Bigfoot” based on a plaster cast of a very large footprint taken in 1967 in
Bluff Creek, in northern California.

This is a change on April 17

Fear the foot

polliwrath is a cool pokemon!!!

Newton’s law of gravity also tells us that the farther apart the bodies, the smaller the force. Newton’s law of
gravity says that the gravitational attraction of a star is exactly one quarter that of a similar star at half the
distance. This law predicts the orbits of the earth, the moon, and the planets with great accuracy. If the law
were that the gravitational attraction of a star went down faster or increased more rapidly with distance, the
orbits of the planets would not be elliptical, they would either spiral in to the sun or escape from the sun.

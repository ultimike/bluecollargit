Hey this is Matt. The legends of Yeti and Bigfoot have been around for decades – even centuries, and I remember my early exposure to the Yeti story 
following the first ascent of Mt. Everest (Sagarmatha) by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary on May 29, 1953. I was almost four years old then and, 
as a budding primatologist, completely fascinated by the possibility that such a fantastic animal might exist. Norgay and Hillary saw and photographed 
huge footprints crossing a snowfield in the high Himalayas (which had actually been reported earlier in a 1951 reconnaissance expedition, but it was 
the Mt. Everest expedition that truly brought it to the world’s attention), and it created quite an international stir. Not to be outdone, in the 
United States, we resurrected the ancient Northwest Native American legend of Sasquatch, baptizing it “Bigfoot” based on a plaster cast of a very 
large footprint taken in 1967 in Bluff Creek, in northern California.

This is a change on April 17

Get off my file..! No, You get off!

I had to do one more change :)
Hi to all who may see this!!!
I forgot my pushups this morning

The Avengers aren't as popular as they were when we started this text file.

Fuego alert, my guy.

Change form Mike Chase - Im drinking cofeee!

Wowzers -- This sure is a file change by Victor.

Today is April 17, 2024.

Carla - I could be a really good avenger if I wanted to!!

Breck - Captain America: The Winter Soldier was one of my favorite MCU films. Iron Man 3 was underrated.

Avengers like to push and pull the infinity stones.

Where are the Avengers?
Hanging out with The Watchmen, they're best buds! The X men are also invited to

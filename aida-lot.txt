Alaska population facts

40 percent of the Kusilvak Census Area was 17 or younger in 2020, the highest proportion of any U.S. county equivalent. Western Alaska is young and mostly Alaska Native, and it has high birth rates. Kusilvak grew over the decade despite net migration losses because so many babies were born there: three births per 100 people on average, or twice the statewide rate.

Aleutians East Borough had the second-lowest share of children in the nation because of its large seafood processing facilities. Nearly two-thirds of the 3,420 people counted in Aleutians East Borough were adults living in employee housing for processing plants. They also skewed male and were more racially diverse than Alaska overall.

Only Sumter County, Florida, had a lower concentration of children than Aleutians East. Sumter County is home to the booming retirement community The Villages, and half its residents were 69 or older in 2019.
